            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">Joh. 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Make not my Father's Houſe an Houſe of Merchandiſe.</hi> This was not done nor ſpoken meerly in behalf of the old Temple, whoſe Glory was now tending to its Period, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhortly the Abomination of Deſolation was to take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58330:3"/>but in behalf of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and with intuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that Purity and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the Lord was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in his Spiritual Temple, which was immediately to be ſet up, and to continue to the end of the World. Wherefore, <hi>Origen</hi> expounding theſe Words, ſays, <hi>Myſtice autem Templum Dei eſt Eccleſia Chriſti, &amp;c.</hi> By the Temple of God is myſtically meant the Church of Chriſt; and that by theſe three ſorts dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out thence by Chriſt, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned three kinds of covetous Perſons, who are to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unworthy to be in the Church, and Communion of the Saints. By the <hi>Buyers and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> are underſtood, ſuch as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, are taken up about nothing but the Cares of Trading for Worldly Gain: By the <hi>Money-changers,</hi> thoſe who having the Charge of the Poor's
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58330:4"/>Alms, do not acquit themſelves faithfully, but miſ-employ the fame, or enrich themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: And by thoſe that ſold <hi>Doves,</hi> are ſignified the Biſhops and Prieſts, who ſell the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and make Merchandiſe of Churches. And, than this laſt, there is no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption more dangerous; nor is there more need of watching againſt any Evil, than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Church from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of this <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; which, when ſuffered to creep in, conſumes her very Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, by filling her Bowels with a corrupt Prieſthood: For, as ſays <hi>Chryſoſtome,
<note place="margin">Super Matth. Hom. 37.</note> Si Sacerdotium integrum fuerit, tota Eccleſia flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret; ſi autem corruptum fuerit, tota fides marcida eſt.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">If the Prieſthood be found, the whole Church flouriſheth; but, if it be corrupt, then all Faith and Religion withereth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth. </q>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:58330:4"/>Wherefore, how long that Spirit of Chriſt, which made the zeal of God's Houſe to eat him up, poſſeſſed the Governours of the Church, it moved them to make very ſtrict and cautious Laws and Canons for ſtopping all thoſe Conduits whereby this Corruption might be fear'd to enter, and to inflict ſevere Cenſures upon ſuch as they found guilty of this ſin. But when that Primitive Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour began to decay, and the Spirit of the World to take hold of the luke-warm Clergy, then began <hi>Simon Magus</hi> again to ſet up the Head, being animated by the ſecret Favour of a ſtrong Party in the Church, of whom (though he knew they would not avowedly own his Intereſt,) he was confident, they would prove clandeſtine Abettors of his Deſigns. And this indeed is the lamentable Policy of this dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58330:5"/>Age; wherein, though Men be aſhamed to eſpouſe his odious Name, yet do they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly careſs and nouriſh him, and cover his Deformities with ſuch artificial Dreſſes, as may beſt ſerve, not only to deceive others, whoſe Simplicity is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed, but alſo, to impoſe upon themſelves, and make them yield up their own Conſciences to thoſe voluntary Deceptions, which may prove advantageous to their Intereſt. Wherefore, (out of a ſingle Principle of Zeal for the Purity of the Church, and Glory of God,) I have reſolved, not only to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask, but to Anatomize, and rip up the very corners of the Heart and Bowels of this Monſter; that, his Nakedneſs being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and his loathſom De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities laid open before the World; thoſe who have never fully known what the ſin of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58330:5"/>
                  <hi>Simony</hi> is, may learn to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; others may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to give it any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: And ſuch as have any way polluted their Conſciences with the guilt thereof, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of this their Wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps it may be forgiven them.</p>
               <p>My firſt Work then muſt be to ſhew what <hi>Simony</hi> is. I truſt it is known to moſt who talk thereof, that this ſin of <hi>Simony</hi> deriveth its Name from <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> yet muſt we not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe, that it had its firſt beginning from him; but that we read him to have been the firſt Author thereof in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and was guilty of this ſin in an eminent degree; and upon this account it is, that it derives its Denomination from him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, by conſidering what the Fact of <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:58330:6"/>was, we ſhall the more eaſily define what the ſin of <hi>Simony</hi> is.</p>
               <p>We read in the 8th. Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that this Man was a Sorcerer, or Magician, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is call'd <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> but when the People of <hi>Samaria</hi> were Converted to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, and Baptized by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> he embraced alſo the Faith, and was Baptized: And when, upon the report of the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> came down from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to Confirm them, whilſt he ſaw that by the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Apoſtle's Hands, the the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt was given; he thereupon offer'd them Money,
<note place="margin">Act. 8.19, 20, 21, 22, 23,</note> ſaying; <hi>Give me alſo this Power, that on whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I lay Hands, he may receive the Holy Ghoſt. But Peter ſaid unto him, Thy Money periſh With the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> accuse thou haſt thought
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58330:6"/>that the Gift of God may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with Money. Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for thy Heart is not right in the ſight of God. Repent therefore of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine Heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive, that thou art in the Gall of Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the Bond of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many who have read theſe Words, think it an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to wipe off the Guilt of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> from themſelves, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that there is no <hi>Simony,</hi> but the offering to buy the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, which they deem to have been the peculiar Fact of <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> which none, or few elſe, can ever ſtumble upon. But how ſuperficially they paſs over the Text, and that they either do not, or are not willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58330:7"/>the ſame, may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any who looks more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into, and more ſeriouſly conſidereth the Matter contain'd therein. For it may be evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded from the Words, That not only <hi>Buying,</hi> or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or offer to <hi>Buy;</hi> but alſo <hi>Selling,</hi> or a Deſire, or offer to <hi>Sell:</hi> And not only the <hi>Buying</hi> or <hi>Selling</hi> of the <hi>Gift of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but alſo of other Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Sacred Things which have affinity therewith, is here condemned, and comes within the Predicament of <hi>Simon</hi>'s ſin.</p>
               <p>That, not only <hi>Buying,</hi> but <hi>Selling,</hi> or a Deſire, or offer to <hi>Sell,</hi> as well as to <hi>Buy,</hi> is here condemned, is evident: <hi>Firſt,</hi> In regard that <hi>Peter</hi> here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that he thought the Gift of God could be <hi>bought</hi> with Money; now if he condemns him for deſiring
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58330:7"/>and offering to <hi>buy,</hi> ſhould it not have been as ſinful in <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> if he ſhould have ſtruck in with <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in the bargain, and ſhould have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to <hi>ſell</hi> what could not be <hi>bought?</hi> And had <hi>Simon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> made the offer, might it not have been as juſtly ſaid to him, <hi>Thy Money periſh with thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt thought, that the Gift of God could be</hi> ſold <hi>for Money?</hi> 2dly, Becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been the Deſign of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to <hi>buy</hi> this Gift, that by <hi>ſelling</hi> the ſame again, and making Merchandiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he might make his own Gain: For ſeeing the hope of his Gain by his Sorceries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had bewitched the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> of a long time, was now gone; he no doubt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make the <hi>giving of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> a gainful Trade for himſelf; and therefore offered
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58330:8"/>Money for this Power;

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It may appear from the ground and reaſon whereupon the Apoſtle condemns this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and that was, becauſe he <hi>thought that the</hi> Gift of God <hi>could be purchaſed with Money.</hi> So that whilſt he condemns him for offering to buy the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt upon this account, that it is <hi>the Gift of God,</hi> he excludes what is the Gift of God from being the ſubject of Merchandiſe, or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58330:9"/>Matter that can come under buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſelling: And ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, there are other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this particular extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gift of the Holy Choſt, which <hi>Simon</hi> would have bought; which, becauſe they are <hi>the Gifts of God,</hi> cannot be bought or ſold.</p>
               <p>Yet, are not the Words ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to be extended, as that they ſhould be underſtood to comprehend under this Sentence, all Gifts which come from the Hand of God; but it is to be conſidered; that things Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Secular, which God is pleaſed to beſtow in common, upon the Infidel, as well as upon the Believer; upon thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as well as upon thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church as Houſes, Riches, Food, Raiment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the Gifts of God; and yet, that theſe things may be ſold, and bought, and purchaſed with Money, there
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58330:9"/>is no doubt; becauſe, though they come principally from the Hand of God, as the Author and Giver of every good thing; yet, in regard they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attained by ordinary Means, and are the Fruits of Humane Induſtry, as God is pleas'd to bleſs the ſame; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he alloweth them to be made the ſubject of Commerce, giving unto Men a Right and Power to diſpoſe thereof as their own proper Goods. Wherefore the Gifts here meant, muſt be things of another nature, which none can lay claim to as their Propriety; but God alone, whoſe peculiar Gifts they are, reſerved to be beſtowed upon his Church, or ſpecial Perſons unto whom he is pleaſed to diſpenſe them; and are ſuch as have affinity with, or relation to that Gift which giveth the ground and occaſion of the Apoſtles Words, to wit, of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58330:10"/>the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and ſuch are only <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or <hi>Sacred Things.</hi> And that it may appear, that theſe, in regard of this Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are more peculiarly the Gifts of God, and ſo not ſubject to buying or ſelling; it is to be conſider'd, That Sacred and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Things are ſuch, either <hi>ex ſua natura,</hi> of their own nature; or, <hi>ex inſtitutione Divina,</hi> by God's Ordinance and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Some things are Spiritual of their own nature; ſuch are, all the Graces and Gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, whether ordinary or extraordinary: And theſe are called the <hi>Gifts of God;</hi> becauſe, as his peculiar Gifts, they are given and beſtowed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, according as in his Wiſdom he is pleaſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the ſame for the good of his Church.

               <p>Some things again are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spiritual, becauſe they are ſuch by the Ordinance and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God; and that two ways: Some things are ſuch, as being Inſtruments and Means appointed by God for

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58330:11"/>Appointment reckoned Spiritual, as being conjoin'd and annexed to Sacred and Spiritual Things, as Miniſteries and Helps thereto. Thus things ſet apart and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Holy and Spiritual Uſes, and for the ſupport and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of Spiritual Offices, with the Rights and Titles thereto, though in their own nature they be things Temporal, yet, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of this connexion to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Things, they become Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Spiritual. And theſe things God lays claim to, and ſeals them as his peculiar <hi>Gifts:</hi> Thus the Lord calls the Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tythes, Firſt-Fruits, and Devoted Things, ſet apart for the Prieſts and Levites, <hi>his Gifts;</hi> ſaying expreſly more than once, <hi>I have given them unto you.</hi>

               <p n="2">2dly, It is a known Rule, That in expounding the Law of God, under the prohibition of any one Sin, it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that all Sins of the ſame kind, whether more or leſs hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; and alſo, all things which are the proper Miniſtries, Helps, Occaſions, Acceſſaries, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements thereto, are prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and condemn'd.

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:58330:13"/>is condemned by the Apoſtle, for offering Money for the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, not only under this, is to be underſtood the buying or felling of that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gift of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for which he intended to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but alſo, all bargaining for other <hi>Sacred and Spiritual Things,</hi> and for what are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Miniſteries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, (as being upon that account Spiritual,) is here condemned, as being in the ſame Predicament with the ſin of <hi>Simon,</hi> in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting theſe Spiritual Things to buying and ſelling, which are the improper Matter of Merchandiſe.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58330:15"/>though it never come in Effect to a Paction or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; as it was in the caſe of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> himſelf, who was guilty in the Thought of his Heart, and in the Offer of his Money, but did effectuate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Wherefore, it may more fully be defined thus: <hi>Simonia eſt peccatum circa Spiritualia, quo impretiabile Dei Donum ſub pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ponitur; Simony is a Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Spiritual Things, whereby the unvaluable Gift of God is put under a Price, or ſubjected to Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> And this Definition doth include both the former; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, whether it be by a real Paction, that one buys or ſells Spiritual Things; or, whether it be in Affection; or, that by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, he expreſſeth his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to do ſo; whether it be by Deed, or whether it be by Deſire, he proſtitutes to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe the Gifts of God, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58330:15"/>cannot be priz'd. As likewiſe, under the name of <hi>Spiritual Things,</hi> this comprehendeth theſe which the former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions call <hi>Things annexed to Spiritual Things;</hi> becauſe, by Virtue of that Annexation or Connexion, (as I have ſhewed) they become, through God's Appointment, Sacred and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. And this Definition may be well gathered from the Text; which holds out, that the Sin of <hi>Simon</hi> was about a thing Spiritual, <hi>The Gift of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And, that his Treſpaſs thereabout was, That that Gift of God which could not be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, nor purchaſed with Sums of Money, he would have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to a Price, and offered Money for it. And all <hi>Simony</hi> being but the tranſcript of his Sin, it may then rightly be thus defined.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58330:16"/>
               <p>And hence it is evident, That all buying, or ſelling, or bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Spiritual Things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſuch in their own Nature, (as all the Gifts and Graces of the Holy Ghoſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary or extraordinary,) or whether they be ſuch by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution; and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Inſtruments and Means for working Spiritual Effects, (as the Word, the Sacraments, the Spiritual Offices in the Church, Vocation, Ordination, Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to exerciſe theſe Offices, and the Exerciſe or Adminiſtration of Spiritual Things thereby;) or as Miniſteries and Helps to Spiritual Things; (as Things Conſecrated and Devoted, and Benefices and Maintainances ſet apart for the utility and ſupport of Spiritual Offices, with the Preſentations, Rights and Titles thereto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) All buying, or ſelling, or bargaining (I ſay,)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58330:16"/>about any of theſe things, is <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> and a grievous Sin in the ſight of God, in that it doth put to a Price theſe Gifts of God, which are not the ſubject of Merchandiſe.</p>
               <p>That buying or ſelling of any of theſe things, (ſave of the laſt kind) falls under the Sin of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> is ſcarce doubted by any. But, as for the Matters of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and Church-maintainances, and things ſet apart to ſerve Spiritual Offices, there be many whoſe Intereſt prompts them to cavil upon that Subject: And, becauſe theſe things are in their own Nature things Temporal, therefore they are bold to argue, That all ſuch things, with their Rights and Preſentations, and Titles thereto, may be bought and ſold; at leaſt, the buying or ſelling thereof, falls not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guilt of <hi>Simony.</hi> But, hereunto I Anſwer:</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:58330:17"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we conſider theſe things in their own Nature, as ſeparate from the Spiritual Office and Uſe to which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, they be things Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral indeed, and ſo are vendible; yet, by Virtue of the Annexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Dedication to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of ſuch an Office, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come things Spiritual, and ſo not Vendible: For this altereth the Nature thereof. Even as the Bread and Wine in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, are in their own Nature, and whilſt ſeparate from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, things Temporal, and may be bought and ſold; but, when by Conſecration, they are ſet apart for that ſpiritual and ſacred Uſe of the Sacrament, they change the Nature of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Things, and are no more Vendible. Thus things Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, before they were Devoted, were but Temporal; and ſo Vendible: But, being once
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58330:17"/>Devoted, they could not ſo much as be <hi>altered,</hi> or <hi>changed;</hi> the Lord himſelf hath ſaid,

               <p n="2">2dly, Whatſoever Benefices, or ſuch things as miniſter to Spiritual Offices and Uſes, may be, as to the Matter; yet, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their Connexion (as I have ſaid,) they become Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, as being Conſecrated and Devoted to God; ſo as no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe can be made thereof, without Uſurpation upon God's Right, and Violation done to his Divine Majeſty, in regard he hath avouched theſe things as Sacred and Holy to himſelf; as is evident in the 27th Chapter of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> where the Lord aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth his Propriety in the things Devoted, and in the Tythes ſet apart, for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, ſaying, of every ſuch thing,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58330:18"/>
                  <hi>It is moſt holy unto the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Levit. 27.28, 30.</note> So that, whoſoever tranſacts by way of buying or ſelling, for Benefices, or any part of the Church-livings, or Stipends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated for the Miniſtery of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Offices, cannot ſhun to incur the Guilt, either of <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> or <hi>Sacrilege.</hi> If it be done meerly in contemplation of the Benefice, without intuition to the Office, but only that the Buyer may enjoy the Church-Revenue, without any purpoſe to exerciſe or diſcharge the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to which it is annexed; he who either buyeth or ſelleth a Benefice ſo, becomes guilty of groſs <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> in that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joineth and ſeparateth what God hath join'd together, and comes under that Increpation and Curſe, uttered from the Mouth of the Lord by <hi>Malachy,</hi> againſt thoſe that rob God, ſaying, <hi>Will a Man rob God?
<note place="margin">Mal. 3.8, 9.</note> yet ye
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58330:18"/>have robbed me. But ye ſay, Wherein have we robbed thee? In Tythes and Offerings. Ye are curſed with a Curſe: for ye have robbed me; even this whole Nation:</hi> And is liable to that Woe, which is denounced againſt thoſe that <hi>eat the Fat,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.2, 3.</note> and clothe themſelves with the Wool, but feed not the Flock.</hi> But if a Man make any ſuch Bargain in order to the Office, intending, that in regard of the Connexion that the Benefice hath with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by a Title to the one, the Buyer may come to the other, he is guilty of <hi>Simony:</hi> As when one buyeth a Preſentation or Title to a Benefice, whereby he may come to be inveſted with a Spiritual Office, and ſo having the Office may enjoy the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; whoſoever doth ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs this Guilt; becauſe, he not only buys a Benefice, which (being annexed to a Spiritual
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58330:19"/>Office) is Spiritual and Sacred, as being a thing whereunto God lays a Claim of Propriety; but alſo, by that Bargain, he comes to be inveſted with a Spiritual Office. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, With good Reaſon I may ſay, That whoſoever buys or ſells a Benefice, or Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto, buys and ſells the Office alſo: For it is a known Maxim, <hi>Cauſa cauſae, eſt cauſa cauſati:</hi>

Only, before I proceed, I cannot tell, if I ſhall need to warn, That howſoever, it was Money that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offered, and that it was for this that the Apoſtle condemn'd him, that he thought the Gift of God could be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with <hi>Money;</hi> that none therefore ſuppoſe, (for I think none ſo ignorant as to ſuppoſe ſo,) that the Guilt of <hi>Simony</hi> cannot be incurr'd, unleſs <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> be told in the bargain: But, whereas many other things may be commenſurate by <hi>Money;</hi> and there be much Merchandizing, and many ſorts of Tranſactions in buying and ſelling, where things of other Species come in the room of <hi>Money,</hi> and become the Price of what is bought and ſold: Therefore every gainful
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58330:20"/>Tranſaction, and every Compact or Bargain, whereby any thing is yielded, given, or received, as a Price intended for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Spiritual Things, is a Sinful and Simoniacal buying and ſelling thereof, no leſs than if <hi>Money</hi> were paid for the ſame. And whereas, there be many ways whereby the guilt of this Sin may be incurr'd; that every one who fears God, and hath zeal for his Church, may keep their Hands undefil'd therewith, I ſhall here lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes, the ſeveral ways whereby Men may chance to ſplit thereupon; at leaſt, I ſhall ſet down ſo many ways thereof, as unto which all others may be eaſily reduc'd; and within the compaſs whereof, he who is any way guilty, ſhall find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf either explicitely or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely included.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:58330:21"/>
               <p>It is then to be conſidered, That the guilt of <hi>Simony</hi> may be incurr'd, either by a merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Entrance into a Spiritual Office, or by a mercenary Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe or Adminiſtration of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Things in that Office. As to the Entrance upon a Sacred or Spiritual Office, Men may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur this Guilt, either as Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Agents, or as Abettors and Inſtruments therein, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipant with them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who come firſt under our View, are the Principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents: And a Man as ſuch, may incur this Guilt three ways; to wit, either <hi>in affectu,</hi> in the inward Affection; or <hi>in conatu,</hi> in the Endeavour; or <hi>in effectu,</hi> in the external Effect or Deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a Guilt of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, in affectu,</hi> in the Affection or Will; when a Man hath an inward Deſire or Purpoſe of Heart, and Intention, either to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58330:21"/>buy or ſell any Sacred Office, or Spiritual Thing, by any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact or Condition for Money, or any thing anſwerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And therefore (as I have told before) it is defin'd by the <hi>School-men</hi> and <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> to be <hi>Studioſa voluntas, vel cupiditas, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">An earneſt Will and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of buying or ſelling Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Things.</q> And this very Deſire and Purpoſe in the Heart of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> did the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> look upon as ſuch a ſin, that he uttered againſt it this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Increpation, <hi>Thy Money periſh with thee, becauſe thou haſt thought, that the Gift of God may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with Money.</hi> — And, <hi>Thy Heart is not right in the ſight of God.</hi> And therefore, it is rightly obſerved by the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>

And a Deſire to enter thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God open the Door, is, no doubt, for an evil end, and with an Eye more to Preferment or Gain, than to God's Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, The Guilt of <hi>Simony</hi> may be incurr'd <hi>in Conatu expri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente affectum,</hi> in the Endeavour, whereby the Affection or Deſire is expreſſed or manifeſted.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58330:22"/>or to procure a Preſentation, Title, or Order thereto, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Endeavours produce the effect of their Deſire, or not,) they are guilty of <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> whether they be the Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or the Sellers. It was but a fruſtraneous Endeavour that <hi>Simon</hi> uſed, when he offer'd the Apoſtles Money; it was neither accepted, nor did he thereby at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his end; yet was he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemn'd by <hi>Simon Peter.</hi> And it was but in vain,
<note place="margin">Numb. 16.9, 10, 32.</note> that <hi>Korah</hi> conſpir'd with <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> by Force and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, to be poſſeſſed of the Prieſt's Office; and yet, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did <hi>Moſes</hi> rebuke him for it, but the Lord alſo by a viſible Judgment condemn'd the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. And whoſoever uſe ſuch Endeavours, their Heart is not right in the ſight of God. Hence it is, that all Offers, Promiſes, Conditions, Compacts, Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

               <p>Yet this is not ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if all Interceſſions in Affairs of this nature, were either Simoniacal or Sinful; but it muſt be conſidered, whether the Perſon in whoſe behalf Friends do interceed and intreat for, be a Perſon worthy; that is, Holy, and well Qualified for ſuch a Sacred Function; or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and unſuitable for it. If he be unworthy, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſins hainouſly who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth in his behalf: For he ſacrificeth the Glory of God, and the Blood of poor Souls, to the intereſt of his unworthy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Friend or Favourite; and ſo doth he, who, to gratifie Man, is mov'd by Intreaties, to inveſt him with ſuch an Office.

Thus, he who either for the preſent, or by any Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for the future, doth Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or Homage; or by any good Offices, miniſters to the Intereſts of Man, upon deſign to procure his own Advancement to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Office, is guilty of <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> as the Buyer; and ſo is he, as the Seller, who, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof, promotes him thereto: For, whilſt by ſuch Service, the one bribeth, and the other is bribed, it is all one as if the Merchandiſe were made by Money.

Yet I do not ſay, but that any Man may lawfully prefer to an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Charge, a Friend, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, who is well qualified for the Office: For (as I have ſaid already,) Religion doth not weaken, but rather ſtrengthens the Bonds of natural Affection; ſo that it were Injuſtice to deal worſe with Relatives, than with Strangers; or, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> not to prefer them to others. But to do ſo, meerly upon a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Account, becauſe they may ſerve better our Temporal Ends and Deſigns; or to prefer a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unfit, becauſe he is a Friend, bewrays an Eye more to carnal Intereſt than to God's Glory.

But much more doth he incur this Guilt, who, for the purchaſe of ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, mancipates his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience implicitely to follow the Dictates of his Promoter; by whom, whilſt he is advanced upon the Condition, or Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſuch a blind Obedience, I'm ſure God hath no hand in the Bargain.

               <p>I proceed next, to ſhew how the guilt of <hi>Simony</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd by others, as being Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Abettors thereof: For who are thus partakers therein, by walking contrary to the Rule of the Apoſtle, who hath ſaid,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather reprove them;</hi> they become <hi>Socii Criminis,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in the Crime and Guilt. And thus Men may be guilty ſeveral ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Man may incur this Guilt by promoting of a Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Deſign, in becoming a Mediator, or ſecret Agent; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Advice and Counſel, or by tranſacting betwixt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or in behalf of either of them, in any Condition, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, or payment of Money; or by uſing any ſiniſter Devices for that effect. And, that he who doth ſo, becomes in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58330:34"/>ſight of God guilty of this Sin, he may be eaſily convinced, if he conſider, That a Fellowſhip in any Sin, by Advice and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, doth ſtir up the Wrath of the Almighty, as well againſt the evil Counſellor, as againſt the Perpetrator thereof; which is evident from that Command which the Lord gave to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 11.2, 3, 4.</note> to Propheſie againſt thoſe that did deviſe Miſchief, and give <hi>wicked Counſel</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and that the Tranſactors for others in wicked Purpoſes, are lyable to the ſame Puniſhment with them; whereof God's Judgment denounced againſt <hi>Jezebel,</hi>

               <p>THE Sin of <hi>Simony</hi> doth not conſine it ſelf within the compaſs of their Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who practiſe the ſame for making way for their Entrance upon the Holy Calling in the Church; but extendeth it ſelf alſo, to the Exerciſes of that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the hands of many who bear Charge: So that, as there may be Guilt by a mercenary Entrance into a Spiritual Office, ſo there may be much Guilt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58330:39"/>by the mercenary Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spiritual Things in that Office; as, when Merchandiſe is made of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the Sentences of the Church, and of the Exerciſe of any Acts and Duties which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the holy Miniſtery: For theſe Spiritual Things being the free Gifts of God, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Matter of Merchandiſe; whoſoever, either in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Affection, or external Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, makes them the ſubject of Buying and Selling, is a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who (as I have told before, in the Words of <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Nicolaus de Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>) would have bought the Power of Giving the Holy Ghoſt, that afterwards by Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing that Power, he might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Gain to himſelf. For, as he who doth but deſign, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire by the Miniſtery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to gratifie his Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58330:39"/>is guilty of <hi>Simony</hi> in the Will, and Affections of his Heart; ſo he, who in the Exerciſe of that Sacred Office, ſets the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of Spiritual Things to Sale, and makes the ſame a Matter of Merchandiſe, and ſubſervient to his Gain, incurs the Guilt of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> in Effect and Deed. And, how dreadful a Guilt this is, may appear by that grievous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepation uttered by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Micah,</hi> againſt the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaying,

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Guilt of <hi>Simony</hi> is incurr'd in the Adminiſtration of the Spiritual Calling, and that in an high meaſure; when thoſe who exerciſe that Calling, do, for ſome Temporal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, corrupt the Spiritual Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpel, ſetting forth things Counterfeit for Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and Falſhood and Errour for Truth and ſound Doctrine. And this Men do, either whilſt by preſent Profit, or expectation of ſome future Gain, or by fear of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58330:40"/>Diſpleaſure, or for conciliating of Favour, or by hope of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, their Tongues are brib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to teach Complacencies, to ſooth and flatter Men in their Sins, to forbear Reproofs and Cenſures, to ſmother the Truth and Counſel of God, to adapt their Doctrine to humane Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Inclinations, and to comply with Men in their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours or ſinful Courſes; or, whilſt out of a ſecret Deſire of Vain-Glory, or an ambitious Deſign of ſetting themſelves up as the Heads of Sects, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſciples after them, they forge new and falſe Doctrines, broach and vent Errours and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and diſſeminate their own wild Fancies, filling the Heads of People with corrupt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which when they have made them to drink in, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon their weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Underſtandings, they eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58330:41"/>betray their Affections, and Proſelyte them to their Party. All which Practices are nothing elſe but groſs <hi>Simony,</hi> whilſt they ſell the Truth, and make Merchandiſe of Souls; whether the Price be the preſent Profit, or the hope of future Gain, or humane Favour, or Fear, or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Deſigns, or Vain-Glory; for all theſe are the current Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> And of ſuch cheating Merchants in the Church, the Apoſtles have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently warned us, giving them their proper Characters. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch, calls them <hi>unruly and vain Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.10, 11.</note> and Deceivers, — teaching things which they ought not, for filthy Lucre's ſake.</hi> And he warns the Overſeers of the Church to watch againſt ſuch,

               <p>For the ſtopping of the Mouths of theſe croking Vultures, (who would rapaciouſly devour the Food of the Altar, and ſtrip the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58330:46"/>Church of her Patrimony;) I ſhall not ſay with ſome, That theſe Words of our Saviour do relate, not to the preaching of the Goſpel, but to thoſe Gifts of working Miracles, wherewith he ſent forth his Diſciples endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Confirmation of their Preaching; nor that theſe Words were intended only for the Apoſtles, and not for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Miniſters of the Church. (Although indeed, the difference be conſiderable betwixt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſons, who have by an immediate Act of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, received a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faculty of diſpenſing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Things of the Holy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and thoſe ordinary Perſons, who by Study and Induſtry, have acquir'd Abilities to fit them, and muſt be at aſſiduous pains to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves for the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation thereof.) But, that our Saviour never intended by theſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58330:46"/>Words, to ſtrip either the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary or ordinary Paſtors of his Church, of the expectation of due Maintainance for their Labours, is evident to any Eye, in which there is not ſome Beam of Prejudice: For, as at the giving of their Commiſſion for the Diſpenſation of theſe Divine Gifts, he ſaid, <hi>Freely ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, freely give;</hi> ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately (diſſuading them from care to provide for themſelves,) he ſays,

                  <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double Honour, eſpecially, they who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Word and Doctrine: For the Scripture ſaith, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the Ox that treadeth out the Corn; and, The Labourer is worthy of his Reward.</hi> So that, when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give;</hi> it was nothing of his Intention to debar the Labourers in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to whom he had committed the Diſpenſation of Spiritual Things, from their Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but, that they ſhould not make Merchandiſe of theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58330:48"/>Things, nor ſet them to Sale, as Matters that might be bought or ſold; but ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe them as the free Gifts of God, to which no Money nor Temporal Thing can be a Price proportionable; which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inconſiſtent with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and enjoying a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Maintainance and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by their Labours; and which to require, is neither <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> nor <hi>Sin.</hi> For it is received, (as it is ſaid in the Schools,) <hi>Non tanquam merces operis, ſed ut ſtipendium laborantis; non tanquam pretium Spiritualium, ſed ut ſuſtentationis ſtipendium neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarium:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">Not as the Reward of the Work, but as the wages of the Worker; not as the Price of Spiritual Things, but as the neceſſary Stipend for his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation that diſpenſeth them.</q> And therefore ſays <hi>Auguſtine,

               </p>
               <p>Thus it is evident, that the Paſtors of the Church are not to be reputed Hirelings, or Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal Merchants of Spiritual Things, upon the account of the requiring and exacting of their Stipends, and the Fruits of their Benefices due from the People for their Maintainance; if ſo be the Benefice be not the end they aim at, and their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Commodity the deſign of their Labours; but that they feed the Flock for love to Chriſt, and not for filthy Lucre, not making the Matters of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the ſubject of Tranſactions for worldly Gain; which, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth, deals as an Hireling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: For the Paſtoral Office,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58330:49"/>is called, <hi>A Warfare;</hi> and as it is in the ſecular Warfare, ſo is it in the caſe of the Church Militant: There be many Soldiers in the War; all have their Wages: But, in ſome, the deſign of their Service is, the Safety of their Country; in others, the deſign is, only their own Gain; and upon this account, they liſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the War: They both require, they both exact, they both receive their Wages; yet, he who deſigns his Service for the preſervation of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, is not to be reputed a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Soldier, becauſe he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards himſelf, not for his Wages, but for his Countrey, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he do require his Wages as well as the other, that thereby he may be ſuſtain'd to attend his Duty: But the other is to be accounted Mercenary, becauſe the deſign of his Service, is not the Countrey's good, but his own

               <p n="1">1ſt, Becauſe <hi>Simony</hi> is a kind of Theft, and that of an high nature. We juſtly account him a Thief, who, being a Steward, and put in truſt with his Lord's Subſtance, giving charge to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe the ſame for the Proviſion and Maintainance of his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and Authority freely to fill all the places of Office in the Family with worthy and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fellow-ſervants; if he ſhould ſo abuſe this Power and Truſt, as either to embezzle his Maſter's Goods, or convert them to his own uſe, by ſelling of Offices, and putting Men in charge for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58330:52"/>Bribes, without conſideration of their Worth and Fidelity, and by making Merchandiſe of his Maſter's Wealth for his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gain; we juſtly (I ſay,) account ſuch a one a Thief, and guilty of a Theft of the higheſt nature, as being <hi>Fur in Officio,</hi> A Thief in his Office and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, betraying his Truſt, and ſelling away, as his own, that whereof he is not the Lord, or Owner, but the Steward; and as enſnaring others alſo into the guilt of his Crime, by making as many Thieves as he hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of his Theft. Now ſuch Thieves are Simoniacal Perſons, who ſell and make Merchandiſe of Spiritual Things, which are not the proper ſubjects of Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Selling, but the free Gifts of God, whereof they are not Lords, but Stewards, to whom the free Diſpenſation of theſe things is committed, and of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58330:52"/>whom <hi>it is required,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1, 2.</note> that they be found faithful.</hi> And, if that <hi>fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Roll of the Curſe</hi> (as the Lord of Hoſts hath ſaid by the Prophet,)
<note place="margin">Zech. 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall enter into the Houſe of the Thief, — and ſhall conſum it, with the Timber there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the Stones thereof.</hi> Their Houſes, I'm ſure, are in a totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, who are guilty of this Simoniacal Theft, of making Merchandiſe of the Offices of God's Houſe, and converting the Spiritual Things committed to their Truſt, to their own private Gain; whereby, they are not only Thieves, but murthering Thieves, whilſt by ſuch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe they make Merchandiſe alſo of the Blood of Souls. And ſo much the greater is their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as the Matters are Sacred which they thus embezzle; and in ſo much as that Lord to whom they betray their Truſt,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58330:53"/>is not Man, but that God who is <hi>a conſuming Fire.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.29.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly, By <hi>Simony</hi> Men incur the hainous guilt of great Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and contempt of God, in ſetting his Spiritual Gifts at a low rate. If ſome great Prince or Royal Perſon, ſhould fall in love with the Daughter of a Beggar, and ſhould beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſome rich Jewels, as the Pledges and Tokens of his love, and ſuch Gifts as might raiſe her to, and ſupport her, and ſuch Servants as were requiſite for her Attendance, in a gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur ſuitable for a Perſon of ſuch high Pretenſions, as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, or future Spouſe of a King; and then this Woman ſhould eſteem ſo light of all thoſe Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Gifts, as out of a baſe covetouſneſs to ſell them; or, out of ſome carnal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to throw them away
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58330:53"/>upon ſome baſe Relatives, or lewd Paramours, or Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of her own; might ſhe not juſtly bear the Character of a Perſon of monſtrous Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and fooliſhly to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned ſuch a Royal Lover, in prizing ſo lightly all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents? And did ſhe not deſerve to be caſt off with diſgrace, as one unworthy ever for the future, to pretend to any Intereſt in him? Now, ſuch is the Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Simoniacal Perſons with Jeſus Chriſt: This great King of Glory, out of his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent Love, hath come down from the Throne of Heaven, to purchaſe us, an Off-ſpring of Beggars, and Muſhrooms of the Dunghill, to be his Royal Spouſe; and for preparing and fitting us for our eternal Marriage with him, hath beſtowed upon us (as Pledges of his Love,) the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Jewels of theſe free Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58330:54"/>Gifts, wherewith he hath endowed his Church,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.12.</note> 
                  <hi>for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore, thoſe who ſell away theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Gifts, or any way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute them to Merchandiſe for any Temporal Thing in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, are guilty of moſt high Ingratitude, and of hainous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Jeſus Chriſt, as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing the Pledges of his Love, and ſetting them at a more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable rate, than is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſmalleſt Farthing and the moſt pretious Jewel that the richeſt Mines of this World can yield; and therefore, deſerve to forfeit his Love, whoſe Gifts they have ſet ſo light by.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, Is it not an hainous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and fearful ſin, to give occaſion of Blaſphemy againſt God, and of bringing up an evil Report upon his Church?
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58330:54"/>That it is ſo, we may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the ſevere Anger of God againſt <hi>David</hi> upon this account, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe he had given great occaſion to the Enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme.</hi> And ſo indeed do they who practiſe <hi>Simony,</hi> and make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of Spiritual Things, give occaſion of blaſpheming God, and of reproaching him of Partiality, as if he had more reſpect to the Rich, as more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of his Gifts and Graces, than the poor; and, as if his Church were a Shop, or Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where they ſpeed beſt, who have moſt Money. And how, alas! doth it open the Mouths of many, when they ſee theſe Sacred Things diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the rich, whereof the poor are depriv'd becauſe of their Penury; and Bribes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an eaſie Paſſage for ſome into the Church, whilſt the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58330:55"/>doors are ſhut againſt thoſe that want Money; and Wealth, and not worth the Argument of Promotion to Spiritual Offices? How doth it (I ſay) open the Mouths of many, to cry out in the Words of that old Satyr:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>— Cuncta vaenalia nobis, Templa, Sacerdotes, Altaria, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p> All things are to be ſold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, Churches, Prieſts, Altars, Holy Things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what not!</p>
               </q>
               <p>And whether it be a light thing to give ſuch occaſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach againſt God and his Church, thoſe who do ſo, will find in the day of their Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, It is no ſmall ſin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Sacred and Spiritual Things to contempt, and to give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to have them vilified and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58330:55"/>deſpiſed as Matters of little worth. It was upon this account that it was ſaid of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.17.</note> that <hi>the Sin of the Young Men was very great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord;</hi> becauſe they gave occaſion for Men to abhor, and ſet light by the Offering of the Lord. And ſo do they, who by their Simoniacal Bargains, make Merchandiſe of Spiritual Things: For they give ſuch Scandal by ſetting theſe things to Sale, as makes the multitude have them in the leſs eſteem, and to account them no more worth than the Price that is laid out for them, or the viſible Benefit that is reaped by them, and leſs worth than theſe Temporal Things which ſtand them at a dearer rate; nay, and in end, altogether to contemn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, reckoning them as Matters of no moment, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Artifices of Gain and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58330:56"/>to Spiritual Pedlers. And whilſt they give ſuch Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and occaſion of Offence, how they ſhall eſcape that <hi>Woe,</hi> which the Lord Jeſus hath denounced againſt thoſe <hi>by whom Offences come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 17.1.</note> I ſee not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The hainouſneſs of this Sin may appear from the grievous Characters and Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God's Indignation againſt it, which he gives in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Let us but again reflect upon the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> unto <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that firſt Parent of this Sin in the Chriſtian Church; and upon the account thereof, we find he gives ſuch a Character of him, as might affright any Chriſtian from following his footſteps therein,
<note place="margin">Act. 8. 21.</note> whilſt he tells him, <hi>Thy, Heart is not right in the ſight of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> And, <hi>Thou art in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the Bond of Iniquity:</hi> And that his Sin
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58330:56"/>was ſuch, as that he could but doubtfully promiſe to himſelf pardon thereof, in that he ſays, <hi>Repent therefore of this thy Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and pray God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> if perhaps <hi>the Thought of thine Heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> And in all our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Life, we read not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he took the Rod in his hand, but when he was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Indignation againſt this Sin, and his zeal for the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Church; and then we find in the Goſpel, that he made a Scourge of ſmall Cords,
<note place="margin">Matth. 21.12.</note> and drove therewith the <hi>Buyers</hi> and <hi>Sellers</hi> out of the Temple, and overthrew the Tables of the <hi>Money-changers,</hi> and the Seats of them that <hi>bought and ſold Doves:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 2.15.</note> Thereby intimating, with what Wrath he would ſet his Face againſt thoſe who would in his Church make Merchandiſe of Spiritual Things. And what Character he gives of ſuch, we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58330:57"/>may read in his Words, ſaying, <hi>It is written,
<note place="margin">Matth. 21.13.</note> My Houſe ſhall be called, The Houſe of Prayer, but ye have made it a Den of</hi> Thieves. And whoſo liſts to read the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, who have Commented upon theſe Words, or written upon this Subject, ſhall find them applying theſe Words of the Goſpel to this purpoſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it to have been the deſign of our Saviour, by that Act, to intimate, with what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure he would have the <hi>Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>Sellers</hi> of Spiritual Things driven out of his Church.</p>
               <p>But let us alſo look back, and ſee under the Old Teſtament, what Evidences of his Wrath God hath given againſt ſuch Perſons.
<note place="margin">Numb. 22.</note> And there we find, That when <hi>Balaam</hi> would have made Merchandiſe of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Gift, and would have ſold, the Exerciſe thereof for Money and Promotion, God
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58330:57"/>was ſo incenſed againſt him, that he ſent an Angel with a drawn Sword againſt him in the way, and made the Aſs he rode upon reprove his Folly. We find alſo,
<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.</note> how God's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was expreſſed againſt <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi,</hi> upon this account, who would needs take Money and Rewards from <hi>Naaman,</hi> for the miraculous Cure wrought upon him, which his Maſter <hi>Eliſha</hi> had refuſed to receive for the Diſpenſation of that Gift of God, who therefore made the Leproſie of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> cleave unto <hi>Gehazi,</hi> and from him to be propagate to his Seed, whom the Lord would ſet up as Monuments of his Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to warn others of the danger of making Merchandiſe of the free Gifts of God, or of uſing them as means of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Gain. I might bring alſo divers Paſſages from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58330:58"/>to this purpoſe; but I think, theſe already mentioned may be ſufficient to ſhew, how hainous a ſin <hi>Simony</hi> is in the ſight of God, who will not have Men to ſerve themſelves and their worldly Ends of him and his Bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The hainouſneſs of this ſin may appear alſo from this, That the Holy Men of God and Church of Chriſt, have always entertain'd grievous Sentiments thereof, and have judg'd it a Crime lyable to the ſevereſt Cenſures and Puniſhments. It were an infinite Work, to bring the manifold Teſtimonies of the ſeveral Fathers and Church-men, whereby they have expreſſed their abhorrency of this Sin, and given ſuch black Characters thereof, as they have not only called the Practiſers and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors in this execrable Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the Diſciples of <hi>Balaam,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58330:58"/>Gehazi,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus:</hi> But ſome have ſet it forth as more hainous than the Hereſie of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius,</hi> in regard that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> ſuppoſing the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> a Creature, made him only a Servant to God. But the <hi>Simoniacks,</hi> acknowledging the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to be God, yet make him a Servant to themſelves, and to their own covetous or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Deſigns; nay, as their very Slave, they buy, and ſell, and make Merchandiſe of him. And ſome again have parallel'd it with the Treachery of <hi>Judas;</hi> in regard, that as he ſold and made Merchandiſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of God, ſo do they of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the Spirit of God. But I deſire nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be at the pains to ſet down in writing, nor to put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the pains to read the ſeveral Paſſages in their Works, Commentaries, Epiſtles and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58330:59"/>wherein they paint it forth as a Sin of the deepeſt Dye: The multiplicity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would make this Treatiſe ſwell to a greater Bulk than I deſign. But having given this ſhort hint, I ſhall proceed rather to ſhew, how, by the Judgment of the Catholick Church, and joint Suffrages of many Fathers together, <hi>Simony</hi> hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Crime deſerving, and Laws and Canons have been made for inflicting the higheſt Cenſures upon Perſons guilty thereof; who, according to their different Qualities, (whether Eccleſiaſticks or Laicks,) have been decreed lyable to Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Excommunication, and to be ſtigmatiz'd and branded with a mark of Infamy.</p>
               <p>Let us then look firſt upon theſe, commonly called, <hi>The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Apoſtles;</hi> (which, of how ſmall Authority ſoever they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58330:59"/>may ſeem to be, in regard of their ſuppoſititious Title; yet may, in regard of their Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, claim ſome Veneration.) And thus againſt <hi>Simony</hi> do they decree; <hi>Si quis Epiſcopus,
<note place="margin">Can. 30.</note> aut Presbyter, aut Diaconus, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">If any Biſhop, or Presbyter, or Deacon, obtain this Dignity by the help of Money, let him be Depoſed; as likewiſe, he who gave him Ordination, and be ſeparated from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was by <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </q> More alſo I might thence cite, but I proceed to what is of more certain Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Let us look upon the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of that famous General Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the joint conſent of Six hundred and thirty Biſhops; and there we find,

And he who is Ordained, ſhall reap no benefit by his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but let him be driven from that Dignity which he hath acquir'd by Money. And if any Man interpoſe, as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, in ſuch vile and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bargains; if he be a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, let him be turned off from that Degree which he holds; but if he be a Laick Perſon, or Monk, <hi>Anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zetur,</hi> let him be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. </q>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Whether they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the Miniſters of Chriſt, who enter by</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?</head>
               <p>WHAT is here propoſed is a Caſe upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, whereof dependeth the Satisfaction and Tranquility of the Conſcience, both of the Prieſt and People, of the Paſtor and of his Flock, in reference to their reſpective Concerns in the Adminiſtration of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Duties. For, when he who by <hi>Simony</hi> hath procured an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Sacred and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Office, receives Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Collation, Inſtitution, and is inveſted with the Charge of a Flock, he Preacheth the Word,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58330:63"/>he Adminiſtrateth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he Exerciſeth the Power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, he bindeth, he looſeth, and in a word, diſpenſeth all things that belong to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery. The People ſee him clothed with Orders and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Church; and ſet over them as their Paſtor, from whoſe Hands they are invited, to expect thoſe Spiritual Benefits which God hath promiſed to convey to Souls by the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel, in thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinances. Now, if he be the lawful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, all is ſecure enough on both hands; he may confidently Exerciſe the Acts of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Prieſthood, and by a good Title Adminiſter the Sacred Things belonging thereto; and they may confidently promiſe to themſelves, the gracious Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Miniſtration. But
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58330:64"/>if he be not, then doth he but boldly uſurp, and intrude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and hath no right to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe theſe Myſteries; and may expect as little Thanks from God for his medling,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13.12, 13.</note> as <hi>Saul</hi> had for preſuming upon a Burnt-Offering; and as <hi>

                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 26.18, 19.</note> for attempting to offer Incenſe in the Temple. Nor can the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple derive any Spiritual Benefit from his Miniſtery, who never received what he pretends to give, and whoſe Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can have no more Vertue, than the Exorciſms of the Sons of <hi>Sceva.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 19.14, 15, 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For the Reſolution of this Doubt, it is ſeriouſly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, What it is that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes a Man in the Miniſterial Office. And I lay it down as a ſure <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> uncontroverted amongſt the Orthodox, That <hi>Ordination</hi> (according to the Divine Rule of Eccleſiaſtical Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy,)
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58330:64"/>is the ordinary Way and Means appointed by God, for Conſtituting of Men in any Degree of the Sacred Hierarchy, and for Conſecrating them to the Prieſtly Office in the Church, and making them the Miniſters of Chriſt; and that thereby, Authority and Power is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed upon the Perſon thus Conſecrated, of Dipenſing the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and Adminiſtring the Ordinances of God. Wherefore, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That in <hi>Ordination</hi> there is a Divine Spiritual Power and Authority, and there is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Eccleſiaſtical Seal. And, howſoever this Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority be conveyed by the hands of Man, as the external Agent and Inſtrument in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Eccleſiaſtical Seal, yet theſe external Rites of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination perform'd by Man, do not give the Power, but are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58330:65"/>Declarative of that Spiritual Power and Grace which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from God alone, and flows from the influence of his Bleſſed Spirit, as the Internal and Principal Author and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, upon the Perſon call'd by him thereto. And therefore, <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita</hi> (or whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe is the Author of <hi>The Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy,</hi>) ſays of the Perſon that confers Orders, That he is but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58330:65"/>Nor can it be rationally ſuppos'd to be otherwiſe; for, if a Spiritual Power be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (as is undeniable,) to the Miniſtration of Spiritual and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Things, then this Power can be derived from no other Fountain than the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And therefore did our Lord and Saviour, both by his Words and Actions, intimate the ſame, to flow from him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Perſons of his Apoſtles, whilſt at the giving of their Commiſſion, he told them, That the Authority and Power which he tranſmitted unto them, was but an emanation of that Power which he had received from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, ſaying,
<note place="margin">Matth. 28.18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth; go ye therefore, and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And,

<note place="margin">Acts 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye ſhall receive Power, after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you: And ye ſhall be Witneſſes unto me, both in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Parts of the Earth:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he meaneth, That they have both the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>, both the Authority and the Power of their Miniſtery from the Holy Ghoſt. And not only did our Saviour aſcribe this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in the Perſons of theſe extraordinary Miniſters, whom he immediately Ordained, and ſent forth; but the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribes it alſo to him in the Perſons of the ordinary Paſtors
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58330:66"/>of the Church, who were Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and Ordained mediately by the Hands of Men, ſaying unto them,
<note place="margin">Acts 20.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, and unto all the Flock, over which the</hi> Holy Ghoſt <hi>hath made you Overſeers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, from ſo clear Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, we cannot but conclude, That to a right and ſufficient Ordination, to conſtitute a Man a true Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and to endow him with a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſterial Power, there muſt be with the external Inſtrument a concurrence of the internal Principal Efficient; as it was in the Out-ſending of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> who received their Power and Authority from God, and the external Seal thereof from the Church; the Holy Ghoſt gives the Command, and calls them,
<note place="margin">Acts 13.2, 3.</note> and their Brethren gave them Impoſition of Hands. And therefore, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> propoſeth the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58330:67"/>Queſtion,
<note place="margin">Lib. De Dignit. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdot. Cap. 5.</note> Who gives the Gift or Grace of Ordination? And he anſwered, <hi>Sine dubio, Deus;</hi> without doubt, God; <hi>Sed tamen</hi> (ſays he,) <hi>per hominem dat De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> but notwithſtanding, God gives it by Man: <hi>Homo imponit manus, Deus largitur gratiam: Sacerdos imponit ſupplicem dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram; &amp; Deus benedicit poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti dextra:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">Man lays on the Hands, God beſtows the Grace: The Prieſt lays on the right Hand of Prayer, and God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with the right Hand of Power.</q> And without this, the external Seal Adminiſtred by the Hands of Men, ſignifies, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Hence then the Collection is eaſie, and the Concluſion evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That he who enters by by <hi>Simony</hi> upon the Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is not to be reputed a true and lawful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe, though he
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58330:67"/>have the external Seal from the Hands of Man, it is but inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, in regard he hath not received the internal Grace from the Hands of God: For, whilſt he comes not thereto by any Divine Call or Warrant, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intrudes by Money and Bribes, the Holy Ghoſt gives not his concurrence to confer the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power and Authority: And therefore of ſuch one, ſays <hi>Ambroſe,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Per pecuniam acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit indebitum Ordinem, &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um perdidit in interiori homine:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline"> By Money he hath acquir'd Orders he had no right to, and he hath loſt God in the inward Man.</q> And he ſhews at length, how no Grace nor Good is conferr'd by ſuch an Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, to put the Matter quite out of doubt, we have the Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, witneſſing, That Simoniacal Perſons are not to be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58330:68"/>reckoned amongſt the Miniſters of Chriſt; for behold, what upon this account he ſaith by <hi>Simon Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus, Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 8.21.</note> And ſo, neither can his Diſciples have any ſhare in the Miniſtery. And from out of the number of his Miniſters, doth our Saviour himſelf plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclude thoſe who come in by Windows, or Poſterns, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Paſſages; and that under a very bad Character, ſaying, <hi>Verily,
<note place="margin">Joh. 10.1.</note> verily, I ſay unto you, he that entereth not in by the door, into the Sheep-fold, but climbeth up ſome other way, the ſame is a</hi> Thief, <hi>and a</hi> Robber. And I'm ſure, none dare ſay, That they who climb up by the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Simony,</hi> do enter in by the Door. And what are they to be reputed then? Not the true Paſtors or Miniſters of Chriſt, but <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Robbers;</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:58330:68"/>and that juſtly ſo, ſince they imitate ſuch in their way of Entrance. And therefore have the Canons of the Church been very ſtrict, in debarring ſuch from the Miniſtery of Holy Things; becauſe they cannot ſay with the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.12.</note> 
                  <hi>I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, — that he hath counted me faithful, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me into the Miniſtery:</hi> For Chriſt hath not put them in, but they have thruſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo are no Miniſters of his.</p>
               <p>The Caſe ſtanding thus, it may give juſt occaſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, What Effect then can ſuch a one's Miniſtery have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on People? For, ſeeing God, who is the Fountain of Grace, hath made his Ordinances the Channels and Conduits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Graces of his Spirit are convey'd; if theſe Ordinances in the hand of ſuch an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58330:69"/>(who is not the lawful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, to whoſe Ordination the Holy Ghoſt hath not concurred, nor given any Power, Authority, or Warrant to Adminiſter the ſame;) ſhall produce theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Effects for which they are deſign'd; then is there no great neceſſity of a diſtinct Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſuch Perſons, as Prieſts or Miniſters in the Church, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom People are to depend, or wait for the Diſpenſation of theſe Sacred Myſteries, ſince they may reap the ſame Fruits and Effects thereof from his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration who is no Miniſter of Chriſt: And ſo, they may as well wait for theſe Bleſſings from the Performance of every rude Artificer and bold Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, who liſts to ſtep up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pulpit, and dip his hand in the Sacred Font, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Holy Altar, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58330:69"/>to aſſume the Power of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring all the Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpel, as well as from his Miniſtery who is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, and ſet apart thereto, by the Rites of Ordination and Power of the Holy Ghoſt. And, upon the other hand, If the Simoniacal Entrance of ſuch a one, render his Ordination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, ſo as his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall have no Efficacy for the production of thoſe Graces and Bleſſings for which God hath deſign'd the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel; to what pitiful Condition and hard Straits are the People, over whom he is ſet, reduc'd unto upon his account! And what Scruples it may breed in them, in reference to his Adminiſtrations; and what Doubts it may make them wreſtle under, in reference to their own Spiritual State and Condition; and what woful
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58330:70"/>Conſequences may follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, what conſidering Man may not eaſily apprehend!</p>
               <p>If, for determining the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Enquiry, we will take the Opinion of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great; he is very confident in concluding the abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectiveneſs and invalidity of ſuch a one's Miniſtery, ſaying, <hi>Quicunque Sacros Ordines ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt &amp; emunt,
<note place="margin">Apud Gratian, Cauſ. 1. Qu. 1. Can. Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cros.</note> Sacerdotes eſſe non poſſunt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde Scriptum eſt, Anathema Danti, Anathema Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipienti, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">Whoſoever ſell and buy Holy Orders, cannot be Prieſts; hence it is that it's written, <hi>Curſed be the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Curſed be the Receiver:</hi> This is Simoniacal Hereſie. How then, if they be a Curſe, and not Saints themſelves, can they ſanctifie others? And, ſeeing they are not in the Body of Chriſt, how can they either deliver or receive his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58330:70"/>Body? He who is Curſed, how can he Bleſs?</q> But how far ſoever we may go along with him, as to the ineffective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a one's Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet, in ſo far as he builds the ſame upon Arguments, whereby it would follow, That the Efficacy of the Miniſtery ſhould depend upon the Grace or Sanctity of the Inſtrument, we cannot comply with him therein; the Conſequence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerous, and ſuch as may ſeem to ſavour too much of the Leaven of the <hi>Donatiſts, Luciferians,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolici, &amp;c.</hi> contrary to the received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Catholick Church, and refuted by ſeveral of the Antients, as <hi>Auguſtine, Optatus Milevitanus, Jerome,</hi> and many others; ſhewing, That it doth not prejudice the Increaſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that ſoweth, do it with polluted or with pure hands,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58330:71"/>if ſo be the Seed be good, and the Soil be fertile, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Clouds and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens not reſtrained: And the Houſe may receive Light by the Taper which ſhines from an earthen as well as from a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Candleſtick. And if there were no good to be reaped by the Miniſtery of wicked Men, but that the Miniſtrations of unſanctified Perſons were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ineffectual, Chriſt would never have commanded People to hear the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees;
<note place="margin">Matth. 23.2, 3.</note> nor would he have ſent forth <hi>Judas</hi> amongſt the Twelve,
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.5, 6.</note> to gather in the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> of whoſe Miniſtery we hear no leſs Effects than of the reſt. Nay, he tells plainly, that many Reprobates in the Great Day, ſhall plead the Effects of their Miniſtery,
<note place="margin">Matth. 7.22, 23.</note> ſaying, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied in

                  <hi>We have this Treaſure in earthen Veſſels, that the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Power may be of God, and not of us;</hi> he will have us to underſtand, That the Efficacy of the Goſpel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon the Inſtrument, but upon the Author, who can render a Bleſſing effectual as well from the Mouth of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> as from the Mouth of <hi>Aaron;</hi> and can waſh a Soul from Sin, as well by the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm

But all this while, we ſpeak of thoſe whom we ſuppoſe to have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by a lawful Miniſter to diſpenſe the Myſteries of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But the matter of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Enquiry, concerning the Efficacy of his Miniſtrations who enters by <hi>Simony,</hi> proceeds upon another <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> to wit, That ſuch a one is not the Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt; and this being already prov'd, we cannot but approve of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Poſition, That <hi>Quicunque Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cros Ordines vendunt &amp; emunt, Sacerdotes eſſe non poſſunt:</hi>

               <p>Now, upon this account, it hath not only been much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd by ſome, Whether any Spiritual Bleſſing or Benefit can be deriv'd from the Miniſtery of ſuch; but it hath been confidently aſſerted, not only by <hi>Gregory,</hi> but by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That the Miniſtrations of ſuch are altogether ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and can confer no good, nor tranſmit any Spiritual Grace or Bleſſing.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58330:73"/>theſe Holy Myſteries, they do but ſacrilegiouſly uſurp, without Authority from God, and ſo do diſpenſe them in vain, and with an ineffective Hand; the bare external Seal of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the hands of Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, being of no force to work theſe Effects, which are the proper Emanations of the Holy Ghoſt; ſo that their Adminiſtrations can be no more valid, than a Remiſſion to a guilty Perſon from his Hand, who had ſurreptitiouſly affix'd the King's Seal thereto, and without his Royal Conſent or Authority, had uſurped the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an Herauld to proclaim it. And therefore, it was not a groundleſs Debate wherewith the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for ſeveral Years, in the time of <hi>Leo</hi> IX. Whether Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations conferr'd by ſuch Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacal
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58330:74"/>Uſurpers, were effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual? Or, Whether they ſhould be Re-Ordain'd who had been Ordain'd by them? And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, <hi>Petrus Damiani</hi> wrote his Book, call'd <hi>Gratiſſimus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who pleaded for Re-Ordination: And <hi>Leo</hi> in two ſeveral Councils at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Tom. 3. p. 2.</note> allowed thoſe who had been Ordained by ſuch, to continue in their Office, after the doing of Forty days Penance; yet, this ſeems to have been but of Indulgence, and to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded rather from Neceſſity than Choice; in reſpect of the Tumult that was raiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and in regard that a more ſtrict Courſe would have occaſion'd the Silencing of an infinite number of the Clergy, and the laying waſte ſuch a multitude of Churches, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Territories ſhould have been without the ſound of the Goſpel,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58330:74"/>to the great prejudice of the Chriſtian Religion; as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the ſame <hi>Petrus Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miani</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Ravenna.</hi> And yet, I think <hi>Leo</hi> did right, not to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordain them; but rather, upon their Repentance, to re-inveſt them with better Authority in the Exerciſe of their Office, ſince they had once received Orders, how ineffective ſoever, through the want of the Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with a Simoniacal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer; yet, the Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the external Seal of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, once inveſted ſuch a one with an Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to tranſmit the ſame unto others; it had not been convenient, that the Church ſhould have call'd the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of her own Ordination in queſtion: Neither needed they who had receiv'd the ſame from the hand of ſuch, but the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58330:75"/>Church's Approbation, for their Adminiſtration; and devout Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God, for the Power of the Holy Ghoſt to render it effectual. And therefore ſays the <hi>Canon Law,

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It being undeniable, that the whole Efficacy of the Miniſtery depends upon God, and that the Spiritual Effects thereof flow wholly from that Power wherewith he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and inable Men to Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and from the Concourſe of his Holy Spirit with them therein: (For,

<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.7.</note> Neither is he that plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing, neither he that watereth any thing, but God that giveth the Increaſe:</hi>) It will then undoubtedly follow, That the external Rites of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can tranſmit no Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Efficacy into his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry who receives the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Call, and concurrence of the Holy Ghoſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any promiſe of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon his Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now, that he who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58330:76"/>by <hi>Simony</hi> upon the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Office, is deſtitute of theſe, may be evident without much arguing: For, who can ſuppoſe that he is Call'd of God, or that the Holy Ghoſt hath given Authority to his Ordination, who hath procur'd the ſame by ſiniſter means, ſince our Saviour hath told us, that ſuch are but <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Robbers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 10.</note> who have not entered in by him who is the Door? Or, upon what War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or Promiſe can he ſtep out to Officiate in that Function, in hope of any gracious Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, of whom the Holy Ghoſt doth witneſs, That he hath <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part,

And whereas, God hath ſaid of ſuch as do unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly uſurp, and thruſt themſelves upon ſuch an Imployment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58330:76"/>his Commiſſion or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>I ſent them not,
<note place="margin">Jer. 23.32.</note> nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them; therefore they ſhall not profit this People at all, ſaith the Lord:</hi> What Fruit or Effect then, what Bleſſing or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, can be expected from his hands, to whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no Commiſſion, upon whom the Spirit of God hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in Ordination, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whom he hovers not in his Adminiſtrations, to render them productive of theſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he hath deſign'd his Ordinances to work by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>But what then ſhall become of the Flock, over which he is ſet?</p>
               <p>To this I ſay, That truly I look upon it as one of the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Diſpenſations that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a People, to be given over
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58330:77"/>to the Charge of a Simoniacal Perſon: For, ſince the Prieſt's Miniſtery is the Inſtrument of conveying all the Bleſſings which are annexed to the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Evangelical Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, What can be thought, but that God hath a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with that People, whom he gives up to the Conduct of thoſe from whom they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive none of theſe Bleſſings? But in this Caſe, as divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may in the ſame Flock, have different Perſuaſions about it; ſo muſt we cautiouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh and difference them, according to their various Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents thereof. There may be ſome, to whom the <hi>Simony</hi> of ſuch a Paſtor is notorious and and known, but reflected upon by them with Grief and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret: There may be others who know it, and yet do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly comply with him: And
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58330:77"/>there may alſo be many, who are altogether ignorant thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To thoſe who know a Paſtor to have conveyed himſelf in upon them by Simoniacal Means, and are griev'd that they ſhould be given over to ſuch a hopeleſs Miniſtery, I ſay; it highly concerns them, to ſearch into the Cauſe of God's Controverſie with them; and it is like, they ſhall find it to be ſuch as provoked God of old, to give over his People to the like Judgment, to the ſeduction of falſe and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prophets, and of covetous and careleſs, cruel and fooliſh Shepherds and Watchmen; to wit, becauſe they deſpiſed his Word, and were diſobedient and rebellious to the Voice of his faithful Meſſengers;
<note place="margin">Mic. 2.6, 11. and 3.6, 7, 11. Zeph. 3.4. Zech. 11.16.</note> as may appear from <hi>Micah, Zephaniah, Zechariah,</hi> and others of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58330:78"/>Prophets. And it is no doubt, People's contempt of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and unfruitfulneſs under the Labours of faithful Paſtors, that provokes God to remove ſuch from them, and to give them over to ſuch Thieves, and Robbers, and Hirelings, whoſe Miniſtery can do them no good. And therefore, the only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel I can give to thoſe in ſuch a condition, is, ſeriouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon, and with Sorrow to be humbled in the ſight of God for this Sin, and by ſtrict Bonds to devote themſelves for the future, to a greater love and regard of the Goſpel, to a more reverend eſteem of, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto faithful Miniſters, and to a better improvement of the Means of Grace. This is the moſt hopeful Means and Method I know, for a ſpeedy removal of this Judgment, and for reſcuing them from that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58330:78"/>Snare whereinto their Sins have intangled them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for thoſe to whom this Simoniacal Entrance of ſuch a one into the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Charge is known, and yet by them a ready compliance yielded unto him; not only ſhall his Adminiſtrations prove to ſuch ineffectual; but by their conſent and compliance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they involve themſelves in the guilt of his ſinful Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whilſt thus they have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the unfruitful work of Darkneſs, and ſeeing his Spiritual Theft, do conſent unto him; a Sin evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.18. Eph. 5.11.</note> both by the Pſalmiſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Apoſtle of the Gentiles. And upon this account, <hi>Aquinas</hi> concludes, That none ſhould Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Orders, nor accept
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58330:79"/>of Ordination from his hand who is known to be promoted by <hi>Simony;</hi> whilſt he ſays, <hi>Quod ille qui Simoniace recipit Sacrum Ordinem,
<note place="margin">Thom. 22ae. Qu. 100. Art. 6.</note> &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">That he who Simoniacally receives Holy Orders, he receives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Character of Order, in regard of the Efficacy of that Sacrament; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he receives neither the Grace, nor the Execution of that Order: And that, becauſe he hath ſurreptitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by theft, taken the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, or Seal, contrary to the Will of the Principal Lord; and therefore, he ſtands juſtly Suſpended, both as to himſelf, to wit, That he do not meddle with the Execution of his Order; and as to others, to wit, That none Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</q> Nay farther, he ſays,
<note place="margin">Loco ſup. cit.</note> That <hi>Nec propter prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58330:79"/>ejus, nec propter Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municationem, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">Neither for his Command, nor for the Thunderbolts of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, ſhould any Man be moved to receive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from his hands whom he knows to have been Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in a Simoniacal Way.</q> And all this he aſſerts, both upon the account of the want of Efficacy in ſuch a one's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, and in regard of the unlawfulneſs to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him in Sin.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To thoſe who are altogether ignorant of, and unacquainted with the Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal Practices, whereby he who bears the Name of their Paſtor hath entred into that Function; my Charity leads me to judge, That, though ſuch a one be not the lawful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Jeſus Chriſt, yet the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58330:80"/>Ordinances of the Goſpel Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by him, may prove effectual unto them; whilſt, attending thereto with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and religious Devotion, out of a pious Obedience unto God's Command, and an holy Reverence to theſe Sacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, they do in the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Hearts communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate therein, as ſuppoſing them Adminiſtred by a lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But, what Benefit they derive thence, is not by Vertue of his Miniſtery, but out of a paternal Indulgence, and reſpect to their pious. Intentions; whereby it comes to paſs, That, as God oft times gives <hi>Rem Sacramenti, ſine Sacramento,</hi> the Matter of the Sacrament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sacrament; ſo he may be pleaſed to convey <hi>Effectum Miniſterii ſine Miniſtro,</hi> the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Miniſtery, and the Bleffing of his Ordinance, tho'
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58330:80"/>he be no true Miniſter that diſpenſeth it; without regard to whom, God doth oft times concur with his own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and maketh them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce bleſſed Effects, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a private Piety, and as the Returns of the Prayers of the Saints of ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation offered up with pure Hands and Hearts, and of the Interceſſions of the Catholick Church, which She daily put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up in the behalf of all Her Members. For, He who hath ſaid,

               <p>SUCH is commonly the heat of Youth in poſting towards Preferment, that it out-runs
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58330:81"/>the conſideration, not only of the proper Ends, but alſo of the diſproportion of its own Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, for the diſcharge of the great and weighty Duties of the high Office and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which it aſpires: For, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays truly, <hi>Contigit omnes fere juvenes turgidos eſſe, &amp; faſtuoſos, tanquam nubes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volare poſſent:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">It is incident almoſt to all Youths, to be big of Self-conceit, and proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to raiſe their Feathers, as if they could Mount above the Clouds.</q> So that, like <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> they muſt needs be ſet in their Father's Chariot, though the Event of their prepoſterous Undertaking ſhould be, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate themſelves to their own Ruine, and to hazard to ſet the World on fire. And through ſuch prepoſterous Indiſcretion, doth it come to paſs, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Young Men aſpiring to the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58330:82"/>Holy Calling of the Miniſtery, do both in their Entry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and afterwards in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thereof, ſtumble into thoſe Errours, which bewray miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and diſordered Affections; and are ſuitable neither to the Dignity, nor Divine Ends of that Sacred Function.</p>
               <p>Miſtake me not, <hi>Dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> as if it were my deſign to reproach Young Men, or by reflecting upon others, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe an Opinion of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of mine own paſt Youth, from thoſe Infirmities and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which are incident to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; (nay, I deſire rather to be humbled in the ſight of God, for the leaſt Errour or Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, whereunto I am ſenſible that the Folly of my Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Affections have betray'd me.) But what I ſpeak is out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and for precaution, that you may the more attentively
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58330:82"/>watch againſt thoſe Dangers into which the temerarious Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of that imprudent Age, may drive you headlong: For thus it is, I fear, that many are led into the Snare of <hi>Simony.</hi> And therefore I deſire to warn all who are aiming at this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Calling, that they would take heed how they enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhewed before, how great and hainous a Crime this ſin of <hi>Simony</hi> is; ſo now I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure thee in the fear of God, whoſoever thou art, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneſt to undertake the Sacred Office of the Miniſtery in the Church of Chriſt, as thou wouldſt wiſh to avoid the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Guilt of that Sin, and to enter upon that Holy Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſerve him with a good Conſcience therein, who fees in ſecret, and ſearches the

For the Lord will have none to ſerve him in his Houſe, but thoſe who are called by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.4.</note> That <hi>no Man taketh this Honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron:</hi> And it is this, that he ſo often pleads for the Authority of his own Miniſtery,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.1. 1 Cor. 1.1. Gal. 1.15.</note> That he was <hi>called,</hi> and <hi>ſet apart of God</hi> thereto: Whereupon <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays,

                  <q rend="inline">He all ways mentions him-himſelf to be called, ſhewing,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58330:83"/>That he had not courted that Office by indirect Means, but that being called, he came thereto.</q> And without this Call, and Commiſſion from God, none hath right to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the ſame: For,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note> 
                  <hi>How ſhall they Preach</hi> (ſays the ſame Apoſtle,) <hi>except they be ſent?</hi> And therefore, although God hath been pleaſed, for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that confuſion, which vain pretenſions to a Divine Call might introduce into his Church, to appoint an Ordinary way for the confirmation of his own Call, by the Seal of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Ordination; yet, when that Seal is procured from the hands of Men, where the Call is wanting from the hands of God, it is of ſmall ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; it is but the ſetting up of a Man in an Office in the Houſe, without the Maſter's conſent. Therefore again, I
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58330:84"/>warn thee, ſtrictly to examine, before thou preſume to enter upon this Office, Whether thou be Called thereunto by God: For, if without his Call, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means, thou thruſt thy ſelf into it, what wilt thou Anſwer in the Day when the Maſter of the Houſe ſhall call his Servants to an account, and finding thee amongſt them, ſhall put home this Queſtion to thee, <hi>Amice, quomodo huc in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſti? Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> Whatſoever thou may'ſt deviſe to ſay now for thy ſelf before Men, I fear, then thou ſhalt be ſpeechleſs; and what the end thereof ſhall be, thou may'ſt eaſily preſage.</p>
               <p>Now, when I warn thee to examine thy Call from God, I do not bid thee ſearch after it by any extraordinary Signs, or wait upon any immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from Heaven, to aſſure
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58330:84"/>thee thereof; but I would have thee ſeriouſly to conſider, Whether thou findeſt a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe things upon thine own Heart, which God worketh by his Spirit, as things which he neceſſarily requireth in thoſe whom he calls; and thereby thou may'ſt come to know, whether thou be Call'd of him, or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider then the End thou propoſeſt unto thy ſelf in this Holy Function: For, whom God calls, he ſets their Eye upon the right End. Now, the great End of the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, is, The Glory of God, and the Salvation of Man. That this was the End of God's ſending forth Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to preach the Goſpel, that for his Glory they ſhould make manifeſt the tranſcendent Riches of his Grace in Chriſt; and

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note> ſays, <hi>God who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Light to ſhine out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And, in his Speech before King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi> he declares, That the End for which Jeſus Chriſt had appeared unto him, to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58330:85"/>make him a Miniſter of the Gentiles, was, <hi>To open their Eyes,
<note place="margin">Acts. 26.18.</note> and to turn them from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God, that they might receive Forgiveneſs of Sins, and Inheritance among them which are ſanctified by Faith that is in him.</hi> Nay, that this is the great deſign of God in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Goſpel, who is ſo ignorant as not to know? And therefore, he will have the ſame to be the deſign of all who undertake the Miniſtery thereof: For, if he will have this to be the principal End of all our Actions, ſaying,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye eat, or drink, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye do, do all to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</hi> Much more will he have it to be the principal End in that work, wherein his Glory, and the Salvation of Souls are more immediately concerned. So that, if thou be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58330:86"/>Call'd of God, thine Eye will be upon this, as the principal End and Scope that thou aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt at. But he who deſigns not this, but intends his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, or Profit, to which he reſolves to make the Miniſtery ſubſervient, as a Mean to raiſe him from the Dunghill; or, it it may be, as a reſcue from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, or from the contempt of a broken Fortune, I'm ſure, is not Called of God. And it is no wonder to ſee ſuch a one fall into the Suare of <hi>Simony,</hi> ſince baſe Deſigns find hardly Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but ſuch as are procured by Bribes. But, what he will Anſwer, when the Lord ſhall put home to him both theſe Queſtions together, <hi>Amice, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo huc intrâſti? Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> And again, <hi>Amice, quorſum huc intraſti? Friend, for what End cameſt thou in hither?</hi> I know not.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:58330:86"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider whether thou be ſenſible of the weight of ſuch a Charge. Whom God calls to the Work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, he works in their Hearts a deep ſenſe of the weight and burthen thereof; and to this effect, he ſhews them what La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Trouble, and Pains they muſt be at; what Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Tribulations, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, they will meet with; and how they will have many Enemies, and muſt grapple with much Oppoſition and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and what a weighty Charge, the Charge of Souls is; what account they muſt give thereof to him; and how the Blood thereof will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their Hands, if through their default they periſh. Of theſe things our Saviour warn'd his Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> when he ſent them forth upon the Work of the Miniſtery: And this the Lord
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58330:87"/>warned <hi>Ezekiel</hi> of,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> when he ſet him to be a Watchman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Nay, and in hundreds of Texts, the Lord in the Scripture ſets this before their Eyes, whom he Calls, and ſends forth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to engrave upon their Hearts the ſenſe of the Charge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are to undertake the Burthen, that ſo they may count the coſt before they begin the Work: And therefore, when the Lord told <hi>Ananias</hi> that had he called <hi>Saul,</hi> as a choſen Veſſel, to bear his Name before the Gentiles,
<note place="margin">Acts 9.17.</note> he ſaid withal, <hi>I will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for my Name's ſake.</hi> So that, if thou be Called of God, thou wilt have a deep ſenſe of the weight and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Miniſtery, upon thy Spirit; and wilt look upon it, as a Work that requires much Watching, and Faſting, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58330:87"/>Prayer. And ſure, whoſoever is touched with this ſenſe, and ſeriouſly conſidereth what a weighty Charge it is, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make uſe of the Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> to open a Paſſuge for himſelf thereto; nay, ſave upon the account of the Obligation of a Call from God, he would not ſtoop to to take it up. It is only a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſory Fancy of carnal Minds, that, looking upon it as an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice deſtin'd for Eaſe, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and Profit, makes Men run to purchaſe it with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider whether thou be ſenſible of thine own Inſufficiency, and diſproportion of thy Abilities for the Work: For, whom God calls, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints upon their Hearts the humble ſenſe thereof; that they may go forth, not in confidence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58330:88"/>of their own Strength, but of the Strength of him who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them. So as the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cry out,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> And again, <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5, 6.</note> as of our ſelves: but our ſufficiency is of God; who alſo hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The deep ſenſe of which Inſufficiency, hath made many able Men of humble Minds, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to decline, or with a great reluctancy to embark upon an Employment to which they perceived their Strength ſo une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual. Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> when God was ſending him upon his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<note place="margin">Exod. 3.11. and 4.10.</note> ſaid, <hi>Lord, who am I?</hi> and, <hi>O my Lord, I am not elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</hi> And thus <hi>Jeremiah</hi> cry'd out,
<note place="margin">Jer. 1.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Ah Lord God, behold I cannot ſpeak, for I am a Child.</hi> And this made many in the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58330:88"/>Primitive Church deaf to all Entreaties and Arguments, till they were forced thereupon by Violence; which exceſſive A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, though I dare not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together commend, yet it gives me ground to ſay, that if thou be Called of God, thou wilt have in thine Heart ſuch an humble ſenſe of thine own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency and Weakneſs for the Work, as will put thee, if not in fear to undertake, at leaſt oft to thy knees to beg Strength from above. So that there is juſt ground to doubt their Call, where this is wanting; as may be perceived in ſome, who, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as they have commenced <hi>Maſters of Arts,</hi> before they have well ſtudied the common Principles of the Doctrine of Divinity, (much leſs the true practice of Chriſtianity, in the mortification of their Youthful Affections;) begin immediately
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58330:89"/>to court Churches with ſuch confidence, as if the ſuperficial Knowledge of ſome few ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Points of Theology, and the reading over of ſome Pamphlets, had rendred them ſufficiently qualified for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office, never conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Endowments of Learning, Prudence, Holineſs, and Gravity, that are required for the diſcharge of the Duties thereof, and for making them ſhine as Enſamples to the Flock. And hence it comes to paſs, that with a prepoſterous ſpeed they run, to have themſelves poſſeſs'd of ſome Charge; and if any thing intervene, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall their Deſires, or to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſucceſs of their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, then all imaginable Arts ſhall be made uſe of, which the Spirit of <hi>Simony</hi> can deviſe, to render their Purpoſe effectual.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:58330:89"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider by what Inſtinct thou art moved, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign thy ſelf for this Holy Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Whom God calls, he ſtirs them up by the ſecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of his Bleſſed Spirit, whereby he works in them ſuch Divine Motions of fervent Charity, and Zeal for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Salvation of Souls, as they are driven thereby to caſt themſelves upon greateſt Hardſhips, and to reſolve to facrifice their own Eaſe, Quiet, and carnal Intereſts, in a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherein they may ſerve God to theſe Ends. As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was, when he went bound in the Spirit unto <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> where, he knew Bonds and Afflictions were abiding him; the Motions of Charity and Zeal ſo drove him, that he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Acts 20.24.</note> 
                  <hi>None of theſe things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58330:90"/>ſiniſh my Courſe with Joy, and the Miniſtery which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord Jeſus, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 21.13.</note> And again, <hi>I am ready not to be bound only, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> And as he was moved by the like Inſtinct, to lay himſelf out for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to whom being about to come, he ſaid,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.15.</note> 
                  <hi>I will very gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you; though the more aboundantly I love you, the leſs I be loved.</hi> And ſo, if thou be Called of God, by ſuch Motions of Charity and Zeal, kindled by the Spirit of God in thy Heart, will it be that thou art carried to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for the Miniſtery of the Goſpel. But, when the carnal Motions of Ambition, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, work a panting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Office; as theſe Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58330:90"/>are not from the Inſtinct of the Spirit of God, but of the Spirit of the World; ſo neither hath he a Call from God, who is driven thereby. And it is no wonder to ſee ſuch a one ſeek to make a Paſſage for his own Entrance, by the counſel of that ſame Spirit which was the principal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his Deſign, and hath the chief hand in Simoniacal Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains.</p>
               <p>And now Finally, I would adviſe thee, That after thou haſt examined thine own Heart, though thou even find in thy ſelf a concurrence of theſe things, in ſuch a conſiderable meaſure as may beget in thee a confidence, that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of thy purpoſe, and calls thee to ſerve him in the Miniſtery of his Church, yet thou wouldſt not make too much
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58330:91"/>haſte, nor run to thruſt thy ſelf thereinto, before God open a fair Door of Entrance for thee. I cannot but look upon it as an Errour, and an act of too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous ſpeed, for any to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude where the Door is but half open; or to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with an Anti-date of a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Charge of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Incumbent: Of which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, through the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his own Life, he is uncertain of his future Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he alſo throws himſelf upon the tentation of that hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sin, which with little ſenſe, is too commonly lodged in the unnatural Breaſts of young rich Heirs, amongſt whom we find it too often verified:</p>
               <q>Filius ante diem Patrios inquirit in Annos.</q>
               <p>That the Son lives with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Deſires, in a continual
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58330:91"/>longing for his Old Father's Death, whereby he may come to be poſſeſs'd of his Fortune. And whoſoever runs upon ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Danger, is too little pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to the corruption of his own Heart; which ſhould be a principal part of his Study, both to underſtand, and to watch againſt, who deſires to enter upon the Holy Miniſtery: And which, whoſoever ſtudies well, will wait, till God by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a clear and pure Paſſage for him, evidence that he hath Called him thereto, and that he hath not run before God ſent him.</p>
               <p>Yet would I not have any Man ſuppoſe, that I intend, that he who hath been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely deſigning himſelf for the Service of God in the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and finds a proper Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould forbear to do any thing, or follow the lawful.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58330:92"/>Means for attaining thereto. For, though the deep ſenſe of the weightineſs of the Work, and of a Man's own Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, ſhould make him fear, and beware to thruſt himſelf upon it; yet it bewrays too little of charitable Zeal to God's Service, and the good of Souls, when he ſees an open Door to lye like a Block without any Motion, or ſtand idly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, till Men come and hale him violently to the Work. Nor ſee I how he can avoid the blame of a ſlothful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who uſeth no lawful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to put his Talent to exchange, when a convenient Seaſon calls for it. Nay, it gives too much occaſion for ſuſpicion of Hypocriſie, and affected Nicety in any, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath for a conſiderable ſpace, been fitting himſelf for the Miniſtery, ſhould pretend
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58330:92"/>an Averſion thereto, till it were forced upon him againſt his Will. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath exhorted otherwiſe, bidding take the overſight of the Flock, <hi>not by conſtraint,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>A Word of Warning to Patrons.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is much to be regretted, that the Patrons of Churches ſhould be generally ſo obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to that odious Reproach of the Sin of <hi>Simony,</hi> wherein it is the Lot of the Innocent to ſuffer with the Guilty. But that which hath given occaſion thereto, is, That the moſt of Patrons have never ſeriouſly conſidered the nature or end of their Power; and ſome have never look'd upon it as a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58330:93"/>wherein their Conſcience is much concerned, but rather as an occaſion, whereby they may either gratifie others, or ſerve their own Intereſts: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it comes to paſs, that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations are oft times diſpoſed of by them, without due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Qualities of the Perſons, or Weight of the Charge; but that he ſpeeds bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at their Hands, whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by Favour, or Bribes, commends him unto them, than he who for his Worth, might juſtly be Preferr'd. Now, I am ſuch a Friend both to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Honour of all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in concerned, that I wiſh from my heart, I could give ſuch an effectual Warning, as might make them all ſtudy to preſerve their Souls free from the Guilt, and their Honour from the Stain of ſuch an odious Crime.</p>
               <p>I am not to debate with you
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58330:94"/>who have this Power, how you have come by it, or by what Title or Right you hold it. But ſeeing you are in Poſſeſſion thereof, I would warn you to look upon it as a Matter of great Truſt, for which you muſt be accountable to the great God of Heaven and Earth: For, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Vineyard of God comes under your Charge, to look out for faithful Labourers to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; thereby you are entruſted with the Souls of People, to look out for faithful Paſtors to commit them to. And if, for the leaſt Talent that Men receive, the Lord hath told,
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.19.</note> That he will reckon with them how they have employ'd it; and that, for whatſoever Truſt is committed unto any Man, the upſhot at laſt muſt be,
<note place="margin">Luke 16.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Give account of thy Stewardſhip:</hi> How much more will he call for a Reckoning at your hands, who have ſo great
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58330:94"/>a Talent, and to whom is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch an high Truſt, as that wherein the welfare of his Vineyard, and the Salvation of the Souls of his People is ſo much concerned! If then, when the Vineyard is grown over with Thorns, and Nettles have covered the face thereof, through your placing of ſlothful or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Labourers therein, the Ground thereof complain, and the Barren-trees cry out, when their Lord comes to call for Fruits, what will you Anſwer unto him? And, if the Souls of People periſh, through your placing ignorant and unfaithful Paſtors over them, when the cry of their Blood aſcends to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt you, what Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may ye expect ſhall it draw down upon your Heads?</p>
               <p>Therefore I would warn you, as ye would wiſh to avoid the Vengeance of the Almighty, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58330:95"/>be free from the Blood of Souls, to beware of making uſe of, or rather of abuſing your Power in a Simonical way. I have ſhewed before, how hainous a Crime <hi>Simony</hi> is; and I tell you truly, it will prove a curſed Merchandiſe unto you, to ſell away a Spiritual Charge for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Favour, or Bribes, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or any matter of worldly Intereſt. Conſider, alas! What do you ſell? Even the Gift of God which he hath put into your hands, not to purchaſe worldly Benefit to your ſelves, but Glory to him: And how will he take it at your hands, if you thus abuſe your Truſt, and ſerve your ſelves of him? Nay, again conſider, What do you ſell? Even the Souls of God's People, which you betray, into whoſe hands you care not, ſo you get your Price. And what better are you than <hi>judas?</hi> He
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58330:95"/>ſold the innocent Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and you ſell the Blood of theſe Souls for which it was ſhed; he ſold a Saviour, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Rulers; and you ſell Souls, to gratifie, it may be, ſome Friend, or great Perſon; he ſold a Saviour for Thirty pieces of Silver, and you ſell hundreds of Souls for, it may be, a little greater Sum. But whatſoever the Price be, alas, how unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Merchants are you! And, what a poor Purchaſe make you! If you do it to gratifie Man, your Gain can in no wiſe countervail your Damage, whilſt you loſe the Favour of the Creator, to conciliate the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Creature, who, 'tis like, at laſt will requite you as the Elders of the <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das;</hi> and when your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, diſtracted with the Horrour of your Guilt, makes you cry out,

                  <hi>We have ſinned in betraying
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58330:96"/>innocent Blood,</hi> will tell you, <hi>What is that to us? ſee you to that.</hi> Or, if by your Bargain, you have perhaps gain'd ſome Money,
<note place="margin">Matth. 16.26.</note> yet, <hi>What is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> And ſhall not the Lord ſmite his Hands at this diſhoneſt Gain? Shall not this price of Soul-Blood bring in a Curſe with it? Shall it not make the Houſe where it comes, an <hi>Aceldama?</hi> And ſhall not the Curſe of God hover over that Tent where this accurſed thing is hid, as it did over <hi>Achan</hi>'s, with his Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Treaſure? Oh, let the Bleſſing of God be upon your Houſes; and let never ſuch a curſed Wedge come within them. Wherefore I beſeech you, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Man ſhall henceforth come to tempt you to ſuch a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacal Bargain, by the offer of Money, or any Bribe, let
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58330:96"/>your Indignation evidence your abhorrency of ſuch a Sin, and your deteſtation of ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and ſay to him as <hi>Simon Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Simon Magus, Thy Money periſh with thee.</hi> And I'm ſure, the Reward of ſuch honeſt Zeal ſhall meet you in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I warn you, as you would wiſh to avoid the Guilt of the Blood of Souls, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well whom you Preſent to have Charge over them. Do not imagine to waſh your hands from this Guilt, by that frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Excuſe wherewith ſome flatter their own Conſciences, whilſt they would ſhift off the whole Burthen from themſelves, upon the Biſhops and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, ſaying, They are the only competent Judges of the Qualifications of the Perſons, whilſt the Patrons are no more concerned but to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58330:97"/>Preſent them. But pray, Is not the Inveſting of a Perſon with a Charge over Souls, the Work of the Lord? Do not you give him a Title to the Charge? And, if you do it without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable grounds of his Ability for the Work, you do all your part to entruſt Souls to an inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Perſon; and is not this to do the Work of the Lord <hi>negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,</hi> or <hi>deceitfully?</hi> (call it as you will.) And what the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification thereof is,
<note place="margin">Jer. 48.10.</note> you know. But again, Suppoſe the Perſon unfit whom you Preſent, and that you either know ſo much, or were indifferent whether he were ſo or not; and ſuppoſe the Biſhop to whom you tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him, either careleſs, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and apt to comply with your Motions, or eaſie to be ſwayed by Solicitations, to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and Collate him to the Charge; tell me freely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58330:97"/>you think you were not in the wrong to thoſe Souls over whom you Preſent ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in committing them to ſuch a Steward as would ſtarve them? Or, whether you think the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Sin could excuſe yours? Sure I am, you cannot imagine ſo: For, if you will have none of the Guilt, why will you needs have an hand in the Work? Or tell me, What is the End for which you have this Power? Is it not, that you may improve the ſame for God's Glory, and the good of Souls? For which, if you have any tenderneſs or zeal, you will judge your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience more concerned, than to be ſo indifferent in your Choice. Nay, would God there were not ſome, who, having once Preſented a Perſon, how Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſoever, do look upon it as a Reflexion upon themſelves to have him rejected; and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58330:98"/>therefore, making all conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Conſcience ſtoop to the fancy of their Reputation, which they think engaged to eſpouſe and promote by all means ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, the deſign of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, and account it their Honour, in ſpight of Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſet up their own inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Creature in a Charge over Souls. But how ſuch Men will anſwer for a Talent thus imploy'd, the Day of their Reckoning will tell.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, I ſay, I would warn you to conſider well whom you Preſent to the Charge of Souls; and whenſoever any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereof falls into your hands, I would adviſe you, firſt to have your recourſe to God, and falling down before the Throne of Grace, pray him who is the Lord of the Vineyard, to direct you aright for chooſing a faithful Labourer to put in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58330:98"/>the vacant place thereof; and as the effect of ſuch Devotion performed in Sincerity, you may confidently expect Divine Counſel and Concurrence.</p>
               <p>And next, it is requiſite you make uſe of ſuch means, as whereby you may have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Information, and beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for fixing upon a Perſon moſt ſuitable for the Charge. Fame may do ſomewhat here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; your own Acquaintance, and Knowledge of the Gifts and Qualifications of Men, may do much; but if you ſcruple, or dare not, or cannot rely upon your own Judgment, then have recourſe to the Counſel and Advice of others. No doubt, you will not want abundance who will be ready to obtrude their Advice and Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and perhaps vex you with their Importunities; but in a Matter of ſuch weight, I
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58330:99"/>wiſh you to be cautious whoſe Advice you make uſe of.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who ſerve you, may haply be ready to take the firſt Advantage to be Interpoſers in this Affair, and ſpecially ſuch who have a Preference in your Favour above their Fellows, will be very confident in their Recommendations, as preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming they have the ſway of your Ears. But, be wary in taking the Advice of Servants herein, who, for the moſt part, are mercenary, and ready to make ſecret Simoniacal Bargains for a Preſentation, and then move you to give what they have ſold, whilſt without your privity they gather up the Price.</p>
               <p>Beware alſo, to conſult here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any covetous Perſons: For their Eyes are commonly more towards Earth, than towards Heaven; and are wiſer for this
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58330:99"/>World, than for the World to come; and you ſhall be ſure to find their Counſel tend more for your Gain, than for the good of your Soul. And 'tis much, if there be not at the bottom ſome deſign for their own Advantage.</p>
               <p>Beware likwiſe, to adviſe with thoſe who are of profane and diſſolute Lives; theſe will prove no good Counſellors, for choice of one to the Holy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: Such a one will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable in their Eyes, whoſe Converſation differs leaſt from their own; and from whom, they expect leaſt Severity againſt their Vices.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, beware herein to conſult proud Perſons: They will never recommend to you for a Paſtor, but ſuch a one whom they preſume, they may eaſily tread upon; or who they expect will yield his Miniſtery
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58330:100"/>to truckle to their ſupercilious Humours.</p>
               <p>Nay, in a word, I would wiſh you to beware of taking herein, the Advice of any in whom the World, or carnal Affections, or Intereſts, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Luſts, have a viſible Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. But herein, call for the Counſel of ſuch, whoſe known Sincerity, Piety and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, do commend them as Men fit to be conſulted in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs that concern the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether they be Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or others. (Specially, if there be any ſuch within that Congregation whereof he to be Preſented is to have the Charge.) For, from ſuch, you may expect the ſoundeſt and moſt religious Advice. And by following this Method both with God and Man, I am ſure you ſhall diſcharge your ſelves ſo, as may probably moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58330:100"/>for the Advantage of the People's Souls, and certainly moſt for the Exoneration of your own Conſcience.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>An humble Advice to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Governours of the Church.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I May perchance, incur the Cenſure of Preſumption, for obtruding my Advice upon the Fathers and Governours of the Church; but, it may be, I have had occaſion to ſee more of the Danger of that Malady which I am to repreſent unto them, and to hear more of the Reproach they ſuffer upon that account, than is obvious to their
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58330:101"/>Notice; and therefore, if zeal excite me to offer what in my humble Opinion is convenient for their curing the one, and wiping off the other, I truſt I ſhall thereby incur no impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Arrogancy at their Hands; at leaſt, they will look upon it but as a defect of good Manners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Right Reverend Fathers,</hi> The very Title of your Office, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims the Church to be under your <hi>overſight;</hi> and if you ſhould not take care to ſtop the Conduits of Corruption where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe may be infected, it were an <hi>overſight</hi> in the worſt ſence. And there is no corruption whereof the Conduit hath more need to be ſtrictly block'd up, than that of <hi>Simony;</hi> which, if ſuffered to ſpread, produceth moſt deplorable Effects, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58330:101"/>upon the Church the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of her Enemies, the contempt of her Children, and many inward Diſeaſes, to the hazard of many Souls. Ah! How hath the climbing up of ſome, by pecuniary Paſſages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, opened the mouths of Adverſaries, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us as Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who enter not in by the Door, nor have any Call from God; and as Hirelings, who ſerve for bought Benefices? Ah! What a Scandal doth it breed to many Chriſtians? And, how doth it render the Holy Calling contemptible generally amongſt the Vulgar, and even amongſt thoſe who otherwiſe have thoughts of Veneration for it, when they ſee it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute to Merchandiſe, and made a Matter of buying and ſelling? I am ſure, amongſt all the Cauſes of the contempt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58330:102"/>of the Clergy, there is nothing that expoſeth them more to contempt, than this, to ſee them turn ſo ignominious Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, as to make Merchandiſe of Spiritual Commodities. And what evil Conſequences may their Miniſtery produce, who enter upon it by ſuch means, may be eaſily conjectured, if it be conſidered, that it holds no leſs true in the Church than in the Common-wealth, that <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium qui malis artibus acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivit, vix unquam bonis artibus exercuit:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">He that comes to Power by evil means, ſcarce doth he ever exerciſe the ſame Honeſtly; but makes as ſmall Conſcience in his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he made in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. </q> So that the Souls of People are in no ſmall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being obnoxious to all theſe Evils which may befall them, by the corrupt Miniſtery
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58330:102"/>of thoſe whoſe Diſpoſition leads them, when they are in, to ſerve the ſame Maſter by whoſe help they entred. Now you, <hi>Dear Fathers,</hi> are they, to whoſe care it belongs to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy theſe Evils: It is your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Rod that muſt drive <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> to the Doors, and ſhut them againſt him; that ſo the Church may enjoy a pure Miniſtery, the Flock may be delivered from Danger, the Paſtors from Reproach and Contempt, and you your ſelves from thoſe Scandals which the Adverſaries of your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are ready to caſt upon you, as Connivers at all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And, what to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is requiſite to be done, in confidence of your charitable Indulgence, I humbly give my Opinion and Thoughts.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:58330:103"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Much deliberation and circumſpection is requiſite, in the granting of Licenſe to Young Men to ſtep out to Preach the Goſpel. For, ſince the Apoſtle hath given warning,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22.</note> 
                  <hi>to lay hands ſuddenly on no Man;</hi> this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt ſtep in order to Impoſition of Hands, and an Act which puts them in ſome capacity for Ordination, is not to be done ſuddenly either: For, we find by experience, that aſſoon as Youths are Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to ſtep up in a Pulpit, it is, for the moſt part, their next work, immediately to lay themſelves out for a Charge in the Miniſtery: And, if they be either of covetous, or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Inclinations, they cannot have patience to wait upon the occaſion of a fair Call, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſparr'd forward by the hot Deſires either of Lucre, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; if they find out a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58330:103"/>covetous Patron, they preſently join with him in a Simoniacal Bargain. And there being ſuch a multitude of theſe Young Preachers, they ſo throng one another, that commonly the more modeſt, and more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, are thruſt beſide the Door, by thoſe, who, reſolving to make up what is wanting in their Worth, by the diligence of their Endeavours, do more actively beſtir themſelves, and fet their Friends awork, by all imaginable means of Money and Bribery, to attain their end. For preventing whereof, it may with good reaſon be ſuppoſed, that Licenſe for Preaching ſhould be granted to none, but upon ſerious and mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and after a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and diligent Search and Enquiry into their Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not only of Literature, but of their Inclinations and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58330:104"/>of their Humility, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, Prudence, and Piety in their Converſation. And then, there would be no ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, nor ſuch juſtling for Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Mean for the remedying of this Evil, is, to revive ſomewhat of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Diſcipline of the Church againſt it, and to inflict upon thoſe whom you ſhall find guilty of this Sin of <hi>Simony,</hi> either <hi>in cenatu, aut effectu,</hi> in Endeavour, or in Deed, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures proportionable to their Guilt. This Rod of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Cenſure, is that Scourge which your Lord and Maſter hath put into your hands, whoſe Example ſhould ſtir up your Zeal, therewith to drive the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple. Your Severity againſt the Guilty, will not only prove
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58330:104"/>an awful curb to reſtrain others from venturing upon that Sin; but will alſo create an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of it, in thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore harboured lighter Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof; and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim your own Innocency, and holy Fervour, for purging of the Church, to the Silencing of thoſe who reproach you. But, if you prove luke-warm in this Affair, then conſider what <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Great ſays, (as I have told before,)
<note place="margin">A pud Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. Cauſ. 1 Qu. 1. Can. Quiſquis per pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam.</note> 
                  <hi>Participem ſe red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit alienae Simoniae, quiſquis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Simoniacam Haereſin, pro of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficii ſui loco, vehementer non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arſerit:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">He rendreth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf partaker of another Man's <hi>Simony,</hi> whoſoever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Place and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is not vehemently zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous againſt it.</q> Or, if you do not inflict a Cenſure proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the Crime, you not only thereby draw upon your
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58330:105"/>ſelves a ſuſpicion, that you have not a juſt ſenſe of the hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs thereof, but you alſo encourage others to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon it with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er confidence: For, <hi>ubi leves poenae, ibi gravia ſcelera;</hi> great Vices ſpread the more when they are lightly puniſhed. I ſhall not ſay, how the Church of old would have cenſured thoſe whom they had found, though but by their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, guilty of this Sin, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring them altogether incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Prieſthood; but I'm ſure, for ſuch Tranſgreſſours, there ſhould be appointed ſome conſiderable time of Penance, for their own Humiliation, and for Terrour to others, e'er e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again they be rendred ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that Sacred Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When any Man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth himſelf to you clothed
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58330:105"/>with a Preſentation, it were fit you ſhould ſeek to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by what means he came by it; and if you find any probable ground for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of <hi>Simony,</hi> that you ſuſpend your procedure till it be cleared: And ſo much the rather, if he be a Perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whoſe Parts and the Charge to which he is Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is a great Diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For, that may give juſt ground of jealouſie, that all is not ſound. For, though it be the Patron's Right to give him a Title, yet it is yours to look to the Purity of his Entry, and to be judges of his fitneſs for the Charge; wherein, if you find not ſatisfaction, you ſhould be lother to lay your Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Head, than to lay them upon Thorns.</p>
               <p>I know, that in ſuch Caſes, you may readily have in your
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58330:106"/>proſpect many Inconveniencies, and dangerous Conſequences, which this may draw upon you, flowing from the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Patrons, or of ſuch great Perſons as may be inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed; at whoſe Hands you may fear much trouble which they may breed you, together with the loſs of their Favour, and the worſt Effects which their paſſionate Reſentments can threaten. But, may I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to turn away your Eyes from what may follow upon your Doing, and to fix them upon what is your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do? For, he who rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth the Sequels before his Duty, will make his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience truckle to his Fears. And as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. 55. Ad Cornel.</note>

                  <q rend="inline"> There's an end of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Authority, and the Sublime and Divine Power of Governing the Church, if it be come to this paſs, that we fear the Threats of evil Men, and the Snares they may lay for us.</q> But, I hope, the fears of theſe things from Men, will neither move you, to ſhrink from your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor to comply with them in Sin; ſince you know, that your Lord and Maſter hath ſo often warned you,
<note place="margin">Jer. 1.8. Ezek. 2.6. Matth. 10.28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>not to fear Men;</hi> and, that you will find much more comfort and quiet in your Conſcience, when to pleaſe God, you diſpleaſe Man; than, when by gratifying of Man, you diſpleaſe God. And, there is nothing will diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Simoniacal Deſigns more, than when Men ſee you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58330:107"/>to countermine them, and boldly to oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It were moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that you ſhould revive ſomewhat of the ancient Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, againſt Simoniacal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons. You know, the ancient Canons did ſmite with <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> Lay-Perſons, who tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch execrable Bargains. And truly, there is nothing could give <hi>Simony</hi> a more mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wound, than to bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Cenſures the <hi>Sellers,</hi> as well as the <hi>Buyers</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Offices, and to exerciſe the Spiritual Weapons of the Church equally againſt both.</p>
               <p>But Finally, I ſhould wiſh, That your zeal, and care to ſtrengthen your own Hands, for the purging of this Sin out of the Church, would move
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58330:107"/>you by an unanimous and joint Addreſs to our Sovereign, to Petition his Majeſty, to give Strength to your Endeavours by his Authority, in making ſuch Laws, as might not only oblige Patrons, as well as the Perſons preſented, to purge themſelves of <hi>Simony</hi> before their Preſentations be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but as might alſo make them lyable to ſuch civil San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (if found guilty,) as have ſometimes been impoſed by the Laws of other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Pious Princes. And I am confident, ſuch an Addreſs would not only be acceptable, But would have a good effect.</p>
               <p>But now I ſhall ſay no more; and if any will condemn me for having ſaid too much, I hope he will juſtifie me, for whom I can never ſay enough;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58330:108"/>and who knows, that all I have ſaid, hath been from a ſincere Heart, and zealous Deſign for the Purity of his Church, and Glory of his Bleſſed Name; whoſe Glory I deſire my be the end of all my Labours.</p>
